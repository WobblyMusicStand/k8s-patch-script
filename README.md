# k8s-patch-script

These scripts exist to patch k8s certificates on LODS kubernetes labs during build-out.

For labs where there are no workers nodes, use k8s-certs-only.bash on the master. Do not add a lab variable.

## Lab Variable
First, an environment variable must be added to the lab instruction manual. 
This is used to transfer the new join token from the master node to the worker nodes once the certificates are updated.

| Name	| Value |	Token	|
|---|---|---|
| k8sToken | NoToken | @lab.Variable(k8sToken)	|

## k8s-master.bash / k8s-certs-only.bash
The k8s-master.bash script should be employed as an LCA targeting the k8s-master VM.
k8s-certs-only.bash should be configured in the same manner.

This LCA should be configured as follows:
||Value|
|---|---|
| Name	| Master-Update Certs |
| Action	| Execute Script in Virtual Machine |
| Event | First Displayable |
| Blocking |Yes|
| Machine |	*Master VM* |
| Language |	Bash |
| Delay | 30 Seconds **Does not guarantee 100% launch rate, but will allow the VM time to boot in *most* cases** |
| Timeout	| 5 Minutes |
| Error Action |	End Lab |

 ## WORKERNODES
 k8s-master.bash also containes an array names WORKERNODES which must be updated to list all worker nodes added to the cluster at the time of lab build.
 By default it lists:
 
 WORKERNODES=("k8s-worker1" "k8s-worker2")

k8s-master.bash updates the certificates used by the cluster, removes all workers listed in WORKERNODES, and generates a new "join token" which is then saved into the k8sToken lab variable.

k8s-certs-only.bash updates the certificates used by the cluster.

## DELAY LCA
A blocking LCA should be added immediately after the k8s-master LCA, this will contain only a 5 second delay.
The purpose of this LCA is to build in buffer time for the Lab Variable to be set before the worker node LCAs are evaluated.
This reduces the launch failure rate.

||Value|
|---|---|
| Name	| k8sToken Delay |
| Action	| Execute Custom Script |
| Event | First Displayable |
| Blocking |Yes|
| Language |	*PowerShell* |
| Delay | 5 Seconds |
| Timeout	| 20 Seconds |
| Error Action |	Log |
| Script | return $true |

## k8s-worker.bash
The k8s-worker.bash script should be employed as an LCA targeting each k8s-worker VM.

This LCAs should be configured as follows:
||Value|
|---|---|
| Name	| Worker-**Number**-Rejoin Cluster |
| Action	| Execute Script in Virtual Machine |
| Event | First Displayable |
| Blocking | **No for all but the last VM, which should be Yes.** |
| Machine |	*Worker VMs* |
| Language |	Bash |
| Delay | 0 Seconds |
| Timeout	| 1 Minutes |
| Error Action |	End Lab |

## Notification LCAs
Finally, a LCAs should be added to alert the user that they need to wait, and when they may proceed with the lab.
Blocking on only one worker will allow the worker re-joins to happen concurrently

||Value|
|---|---|
| Name	| Lab Launching |
| Action	| Send Notification to User |
| Event | Post-Build |
| Delay | 0 Seconds |
| Error Action |	Log |
